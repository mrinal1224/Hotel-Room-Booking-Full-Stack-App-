# Hotel-Room-Booking-Full-Stack-App-

Full Stack(MERN) Hotel Room Booking Application that will allow different users to book different rooms according to the duration of their Stay and availability of rooms.

Autentication , Authorization, api Routes, Connection to MongoDB is taken care of with Node and Express at the backend

Front end is created with React and for Styilng I have used BootStrap and Ant-Design Components.

Functions-
User can Login and Register.
User can Filter rooms out accordingly( Delux or Non-Delux)
User can Search for rooms from the search bar.

Date Range Filtering implemented User will not be allowed to book a room that has already been booked by different User for the Duration.

Profile Page and Booking Page where users can see all their data and bookings User can also cancel a particular booking from that page.


This is a complete beginner friendly Project with Mern Stack (No Redux , No ContextAPI and minimum prop drilling) 
So newbie developers can get an idea of how you can create a full stack project without any complex tools and techniques
